The CQL in this project was generated blindly from the ORM files
after they had received the tweaks below. It is not guaranteed
not even particularly likely to compile, but may not be far off.
Not all the ORM files are free of errors either.

The generation script (using the Ruby activefacts gem) was:

for i in orm/*.orm
do
	echo === $i
	afgen --cql "$i" > "cql/`basename "$i" .orm`.cql"
done

orm/CCF Query Builder.orm
* Changed Literal to be a ValueType, since it had no identification

orm/Food.orm
* Masking reserved word 'no' in reading '{0} has no units'
* Re-worded to MeasurementUnit is unitless

orm/Genealogy.orm
* Re-instated the Person role player for PersonPassesThroughLifeStageInOrder
* Deleted incomplete populations

orm/HL7 Clinical Statement Pattern.orm
* Needs identifying patterns for ClinicalStatement and "ProviderOrPatientOrRelated"

orm/LexicalMatcher.orm
* Added Term_id

orm/MIAME schema from Chris Stoeckert.orm
* Made spanning uniqueness constraints preferred identifiers
* Many entity types missing identifiers

orm/Microarray.orm
* Made spanning uniqueness constraints preferred identifiers
* One entity type missing an identifiers

orm/OData.orm
* Added QueryOption attributes and identifier
* Needs URL identifier (badly modelled!)

orm/RentalPrices.orm
* Added identifier for NavigationBar
* Badly named; includes both rental prices and scraper data. Suggest RentalPriceScraper?

orm/Talent.orm
* Renamed role name 'agent' to Agent to avoid clash with reading '{0} is agent of {1}'

orm/WebServiceDefinition.orm
Uniqueness constraint ExternalUniquenessConstraint1 has incompatible players ["Namespace", "Name"]

orm/WebTickets.orm
* renamed post hyphen-bound '-1', '-2', '-3' to suit CQL
Deleted ExclusiveOrConstraint1/InclusiveOrConstraint1 because it has only one role

orm/calendar.orm
* Masked object type name 'date' in reading '{0} is by date'. Is an alternate reading feasible?
